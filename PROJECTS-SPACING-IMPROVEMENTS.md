# Projects Page Spacing Improvements

## Overview
Fixed all spacing issues in the projects page layout to create a professional, well-organized appearance with proper visual hierarchy and breathing room between elements.

## Problems Solved

### ✅ 1. Filter Button Spacing
**Before:** Buttons were too close together (default gap)
**After:** 
- Increased gap to 20px between filter buttons
- Added 40px margin-bottom to separate from project grid
- Improved button padding (12px 24px)
- Added min-width for consistent button sizes
- Prevented button shrinking on mobile with `flex-shrink: 0`

### ✅ 2. Project Grid Spacing
**Before:** Insufficient spacing between columns and rows
**After:**
- Increased grid gap to 40px (horizontal spacing)
- Added explicit row-gap of 40px (vertical spacing)
- Removed conflicting margin-top since filter has margin-bottom
- Added container padding for better edge spacing

### ✅ 3. Vertical Spacing Between Rows
**Before:** Rows were too tight and cramped
**After:**
- Explicit 40px row-gap on desktop
- Responsive row gaps: 35px (tablet), 30px (mobile large), 25px (mobile small)
- Proper section padding (60px top, 80px bottom)

### ✅ 4. Overall Layout Improvements
